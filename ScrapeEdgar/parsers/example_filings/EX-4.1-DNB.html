Supplemental Indenture”), as further supplemented by the second supplemental indenture dated as of June&nbsp;15, 2015 (the “Second Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the
“Indenture”, which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the “Trustee”, which term includes any successor trustee
under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon
which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $[&#9679;], subject to certain exceptions referred to in the
Indenture. In addition, the Company may from time to time without the consent of the Holders of Securities create and issue further securities having the same terms and conditions as the Securities in all respects (or in all respects except for the
issue date and issue price) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding securities of this series (including the Securities) or upon such terms as the Company may determine at the time of their
issue. References herein to the Securities include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other securities issued as described in this paragraph and forming a single series with the Securities. </p>
