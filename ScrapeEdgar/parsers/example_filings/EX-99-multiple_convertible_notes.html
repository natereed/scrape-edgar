<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This aggregate amount is approximately&nbsp;$1,036,804,680, calculated as the sum of (a)&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;$228,790,000, representing 100% of the principal amount

equal to the Conversion Rate of 34.6620 for the 2017 Convertible Notes, 13.1745 for the 2018 Convertible Notes and 13.5165 for the 2020 Convertible Notes, multiplied by $102.00 (i.e., the Merger Consideration). As a result, you will be entitled to
receive $3,535.52 in cash per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of 2017 Convertible Notes, $1,343.80 in cash per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of 2018 Convertible Notes and $1,378.68 in cash per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of 2020

obligation to pay the principal amount of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If Notes are converted after the close of business on the applicable Regular Record Date and prior to the open of business on the immediately following
applicable Interest Payment Date, then Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date shall be entitled to scheduled interest payable on such Notes on such Interest Payment Date. Accordingly, Notes surrendered for
conversion must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes being converted, unless the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after such Regular Record Date and prior to or on the corresponding Interest Payment Date
for such Notes, or to the extent of any Defaulted Amounts, if any Defaulted Amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such Notes. </P>

Company estimates that the accrued interest payable on the 2017 Convertible Notes, 2018 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes that are validly surrendered for repurchase on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and not validly withdrawn will
be approximately $7.99, $5.63 and $9.38, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of Notes surrendered, assuming a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date of February&nbsp;23, 2015. Holders converting the Notes will not receive a cash payment for
accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth in &#147;Section 2.3 &#150; Conversion Rights of the Holders&#148;. On the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Company intends to deposit sufficient cash for the conversion of the Notes with the
