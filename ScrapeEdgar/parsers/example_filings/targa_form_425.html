unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date on their series of APL Notes up to, but not including, the settlement date, which will occur promptly after the expiration time. The APL Issuers have now executed supplemental indentures
effecting the proposed amendments with respect to both the 2021 APL Notes and the 2023 APL Notes, and the closing of Targa Resources Partners&#146; previously announced offering of $1.1 billion of 5% Senior Notes due 2018 has satisfied the condition
