Abigail P. Johnson, are the predominant owners, directly or through trusts,
of Series B voting common shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting
power of FMR LLC. The Johnson family group and all other Series B

power resides with the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees. Fidelity

written guidelines established by the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees.

that may be deemed to be beneficially owned, by FMR LLC, certain of its
subsidiaries and affiliates, and other companies (collectively, the "FMR
