March&nbsp;14 and September&nbsp;14 of each year. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from March&nbsp;14, 2008. Interest will be computed on the basis of a

reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S. Code &#167;&#167;&nbsp;77aaa-77bbbb) (&#147;Act&#148;). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture, all applicable supplemental indentures and the Act for
a statement of those terms. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities issued under the Indenture may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may
bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and may
otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series of the Notes designated on the face hereof, unlimited in aggregate principal amount. </FONT></P> <P

price equal to the greater of (a)&nbsp;100% of the principal amount of the Notes or (b)&nbsp;the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Notes discounted to the redemption date semiannually (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 25 basis points. In either case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the Notes
being redeemed. The Independent Investment Banker (as defined below) will calculate the redemption price. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Treasury Rate&#148; means,

Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee or in the name of a successor to the Depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary only if (i)&nbsp;the Depositary notifies the Corporation that it is unwilling

determines not to have all of the Notes represented by one or more Global Security or Securities. If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Notes of like tenor and terms in definitive form in
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Note or Notes of the same aggregate denominations to be registered in the name of such Depositary

STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">9. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay, unless
otherwise prohibited by mandatory provisions of applicable abandoned property law, the money back to the Corporation at its request. After that, Holders entitled to unclaimed money must look only to the Corporation and not to the Trustee for payment
unless an abandoned property law designates another person. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">10. Defeasance. The Corporation may defease certain of its obligations with
respect to the Notes or discharge its obligations with respect to the Notes by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust, cash or government securities sufficient to pay all sums due on the Notes. The establishment of such a trust will be
conditioned on the delivery by the Corporation to the Trustee of an opinion of counsel, who may be counsel to the Corporation, to the effect that, based on applicable U.S. federal income tax law or a ruling published by the United States Internal
Revenue Service, the defeasance or discharge, as the case may be, will not be deemed, or result in, a taxable event with respect to the Holders of the Notes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

principal amount of the Notes, and, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as provided in the Indenture, any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes. Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented, for among other reasons, to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes or to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder. Without the consent of any Holder, the Trustee may waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes if the waiver does not
materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">12. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture does not limit unsecured debt of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries. It does limit certain mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions. The limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Once a year the Corporation must report to the Trustee on compliance with the
limitations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">13. Successors. When a successor entity assumes all the obligations of the Corporation or its successors under the Notes and
the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">14. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default is:
failure to pay the principal on any Note when due; failure for 30 days to pay interest on the Notes when due; failure by the Corporation to comply with any other agreement relating to the Indenture or the Notes for 90 days after the Corporation has
been given written notice of such failure; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of this series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Corporation, or the
Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes, by notice to the Corporation and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Holders of Notes may not enforce
the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if a committee of its trust officers in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of such Holders. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">15. Additional Notes. The Corporation may from time to time,
without the consent of the Holders, create and issue additional debt securities on the same terms and conditions and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes, so that those additional debt securities and the Notes will form a single series of
Securities under the Indenture. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">16. Trustee Dealings with the Corporation. The Bank of New York, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its
individual or any other capacity may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Corporation or any of its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Corporation or its affiliates as if it were not Trustee. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">17. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Corporation shall not have any liability for any
obligations of the Corporation under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, with respect to, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">18. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee
manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">19. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in
the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT&nbsp;TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian) and U/G/M/A (= Uniform
